    <p>In the summer of 2017 I worked as a Software Engineering Intern at Wells Fargo in Golden Valley MN. I was situated on the Home Loans and EarlyResolution team. This team worked with EarlyResolution - a piece of software that thousands of employees use to work with customers and their loans.

    <p>In the summer of 2016 I had the position of Software Engineer Intern at Trane located in White Bear Lake, MN. I was situated on the Security team and my primary responsibilites included working on my main personal project while assisting other members of my team with their own projects. 
    </p> 
    <p> <b> Security Audit Database</b> <br> There was a monthly security audit that collected data related to Trane's smart home devices that would test for any security outbreaks. This info was then moved to an excel spreadsheet and then transformed into a more presentation friendly format for management. My responsiblity was to impove and optimize this process. I worked in Python to upgrade the script that actually pulled the data through scraping the devices. I used a combination of Microsoft Sharepoint and Microsoft SQL to create a small database to hold this data so that it would be more modular and better organized than in an excel spreadsheet. </p>
    <p> <b> Unit Testing with XML</b> <br> One of my coworkers was tasked with releasing a new software update to Trane's smart HVAC system at the time. With the software update, there was a lot of testing that needed to be done. I assisted in this software release by test releasing this update to a large sample size of the HVAC devices. From there I worked with and modified previous Python scripts to run through the XML files that correlated with each device to test for anomalies.
